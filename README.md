# Movie Studio Analysis

# Overview

This project analyzes movie industry data from multiple sources to identify which types of films provide the best balance of profitability, return on investment (ROI), and overall financial success. The analysis is designed to help a new movie studio decide what kinds of films to produce and where to allocate its budget for maximum return.
This repo includes a Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations, and a powerpoint that does a deep dive into the data and the recommendations.

# Business Objective

The goal is to provide three data-driven recommendations for a new movie studio entering the market:
- Low-budget horror films for high ROI potential
- High-revenue animation projects for strong global audience appeal
- A balanced production portfolio combining low-risk horror, family animation, and action films
- Each recommendation is supported by financial data and visualizations of the top-performing genres.
# Key Findings
Horror films have the highest ROI relative to budget. Small investments yield strong returns.
Animation consistently dominates worldwide gross due to family audiences and rewatchability.
Action films generate the largest total profit but require higher production budgets.
A mix of these genres provides the best balance between stability, creativity, and profitability.
# Recommendations Summary

- Fede Alvarez: Focus on low-budget horror. Known for strong ROI with films like Dont Breathe and Evil Dead.
- Pete Docter: Invest in animation projects. Proven success with films like Inside Out and Soul.
- Quentin Tarantino: Develop mid-budget action projects. Consistent profits from Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, and The Hateful Eight.

# Conclusion
By allocating around 500 million dollars across multiple low- and mid-budget films, the studio can achieve steady annual returns and brand growth.
This approach minimizes risk while ensuring a diverse slate that appeals to global audiences.
