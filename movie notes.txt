ROI deviation notes to remember 

This graph shows how risky or consistent each movie genre is when it comes to making money.

Each bar is a genre (like Horror or Comedy).

The longer the bar, the more the ROI bounces around â€” meaning some movies make bank ðŸ’¸, others totally flop ðŸ’€.

The shorter the bar, the more predictable the money is â€” not huge wins, but not huge losses either.

ðŸŽ¯ So basically:

This graph helps you see which genres are safe bets vs high-risk, high-reward plays.

Want to make $$$ fast? Horror might win.
Want stability? Go with Animation or Family.

What This Graph Tells You:

A high volatility genre (e.g. Horror) might deliver high ROI â€” but also lots of flops

A low volatility genre (e.g. Animation, Family) might be safer, even with lower average returns

ðŸ§  Business Insight (2 sentences):

This chart measures how consistent each genre's ROI is by calculating standard deviation. While some genres like Horror offer high upside, 
they also come with high risk, whereas genres like Animation or Family tend to deliver more predictable, stable returns.
